# Agentic Flow — General Concept

---

## 1. What is Agentic Flow?
Agentic Flow is the idea that **Large Language Models (LLMs) act as proactive agents**, not just passive text predictors.  
Instead of giving a single answer to a user prompt, the model follows a **loop of clarify–reason–act–verify**, taking responsibility for reducing ambiguity and ensuring correctness.

## 2. Core Stages of an Agentic Flow

1. **Interpret / Sense**  
   - The agent receives an input (natural language, code prompt, data query, etc.).  
   - It identifies whether the request is **well-specified** or **underspecified**.

2. **Clarify / Ask Questions**  
   - If underspecified, the agent generates clarifying questions.  
   - Each question is designed to reduce uncertainty about the task.  
   - User answers become part of the **fact ledger** (context memory).

3. **Plan / Reason**  
   - The agent outlines possible solution paths.  
   - It evaluates which path satisfies the clarified requirements.  
   - Planning may involve tool use, decomposition into subtasks, or reasoning chains.

4. **Act / Generate**  
   - The agent produces an actionable output (code, query, plan, text).  
   - Output respects all clarified constraints.  

5. **Verify / Reflect**  
   - The agent tests or checks its output.  
   - Verification may involve: unit tests, static checks, sandbox execution, or user feedback.  
   - If errors are detected, the loop returns to **Clarify** or **Plan**.

6. **Deliver**  
   - Once verified, the agent provides the final result.  
   - The process is transparent: clarifying questions and reasoning steps are logged.

## 3. Why Agentic Flow Matters
- **Reduces ambiguity:** avoids guessing by eliciting missing details.  
- **Improves reliability:** verified outputs are closer to user intent.  
- **Enhances safety:** agents can reject unsafe actions or escalate unclear instructions.  
- **Human-like collaboration:** mirrors how humans solve problems (ask → reason → act → check).

## 4. Example (Generic)
- **User Prompt:** “Sort my list.”  
- **Agentic Flow:**  
  - *Clarify:* “Ascending or descending? Numeric or lexicographic?”  
  - *Reason:* Recognize it’s a list of strings.  
  - *Act:* Generate code to sort in descending lexicographic order.  
  - *Verify:* Run on sample input, confirm result matches clarified intent.  
  - *Deliver:* Output final code.

## 5. Applications
- **Code Generation** → write programs that match ambiguous user requests.  
- **Data Science** → build correct visualizations or analyses with clarified metrics.  
- **Conversational AI** → proactive assistants that ask before answering wrongly.  
- **Autonomous Agents** → decision-making in robotics, planning, or business workflows.

## 6. Summary
Agentic Flow turns LLMs from **passive predictors** into **interactive agents**.  
It follows a loop of:
> **Clarify → Plan → Act → Verify → Deliver**  

This paradigm makes AI systems **more accurate, trustworthy, and collaborative**.
